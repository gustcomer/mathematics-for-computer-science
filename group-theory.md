# Group Theory

A group is a nonempty set $G$ together with a law of composition
$(a, b) \mapsto ab : G \times G \rightarrow G$ satisfying the following four axioms:

1. **Closure**. For all $a, b \in G$, the set $G$ is closed under composition: $ab, ba \in G$.
2. **Associativity**. For all $a, b, c \in G$, the composition is associative: $(ab)c = a(bc)$.
3. **Existence of An Identity Element**. For all $a \in G$, there exists an element $e \in G$
   such that $ae = a = ea$.
4. **Existence of Inverses**. For each $a \in G$, there exists an $a^{-1} \in G$ such that $aa^{-1} = e
   = a^{-1}a$.
